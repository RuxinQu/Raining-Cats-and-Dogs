Raining Cats and Dogs is created to help pet owners find temporarily places for their pets to stay so that the owners can take their vacation in ease knowing that their pet will be taken care of while being away. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
